# stockModelPredictor
Personal project to try and compare how ETF's may bounce back like they did after the market crash in 2008.

For the sake of time I did just replicate the Jupyter Notebook files and replace the CSV file names in order to import the date
that was used from yahoo finance with collects history of ETF's like stocks. Using this I was able to narrow take that data and then
filter out data only from 2009-2012. With this I wanted to see how the market may recover from 2023-2026 with the market crash
that we just had in 2022. Since both 2008 and 2022 are similiar as far as how decimated the economy was, it is possible to assume that
growth in stocks such as Amazon, Salesforce, or Apple could be very similiar.
